Hi everyone! 

I am excited to be able to share my thoughts and experiences with you in this first blog. This is out of my comfort zone, but I feel great about my learning, my cohort, and the future.


**Where to begin?**


From a young age, I knew that I wanted to be someone who dealt with computers. I was too young to understand "what" exactly I wanted to do with computers, but I knew whatever it was - it had to revolve around computers. Growing up, we weren't held back from electronics. My brother and I had television, a Sega Genesis, an Xbox, and PSP.  I remember one Christmas, my mom bought me an educational Vtech laptop that had all of the subjects built in. It was mainly used to strengthen my knowledge in the subjects, but I can remember always pretending to be a hacker and acting as if I could type very fast. 

Let's fast forward a bit...

**Middle School/High School**

Here is where the bulk of my love for computers began. One day in middle school, during a Social Studies lesson(I should have been paying attention), a technician came in to repair our classroom computers in the back of the room. I couldn't take my eyes off what he was doing! I just had to know what the parts where, where they went, etc. That's all I can remember about that experience. In high school, I took a course that allowed me to learn about computers from the inside out; breaking them apart, putting them back together, and learning how they function. MySpace also played a HUGE part in my abilities as a coder. Modifying a MySpace page back in the day was the equivalent of being a developer. Haha. Don't come for me, but that's how I felt back then. 

**So Why Now Exactly?**

Although I like teaching and I love each of my students, this is what I really want to do. In college, I was originally a Computer Science major, but was forced to switch majors, because of the requirement to transfer to a new university after two years. My mom wasn't having that, so I had to switch majors. Education has been a rewarding and enlightening journey. However, I'm on to new experiences, new highs, new lows, and new opportunities. I am excited for where this road will take me and to see personal and professional growth.
