Hi, everyone. Taking a different apporach, I'd like to share my learning experience while building my Rails project. Throughout the process of building my app, I learned what it means to really "break your code." While building my project, I've come across what seems to be an enormous amount of errors. I would sit and code for hours; googling, reading, and coding. If I reached an impasse, I would inadvertently repeat the cycle to no avail.

Asking For Help
As much as I'd love to be able to code an entire app with no errors on the first attempt, that wasn't my experience. However, I am happy that we have a supportive group of cohorts and amazingly helpful instructors to guide us along the way. In reaching out to them, I've broken my code and understood more of what my code was doing. 

Rails Console
The rails console has become my best friend. I suppose it's safe to say that errors and the console have made me a better developer than I was before beginning this project. Progress. There was a moment when I was stuck on an error in my controller action and felt I exhausted all of my resources.  My instructor and cohorts gave me a suggestion and using the rails console helped me progress in understanding. I was beginning to see that not only was my code not working, but I can see why it isn't working. Building a project is different from completing labs. You really get your hands dirty when building a project and those mistakes/errors assist in learning. As a result, I spent a lot of time in the rails console, checking the database, routes, and debugging. 

I am going to continue building this project and the learning experiences gained during the process.
